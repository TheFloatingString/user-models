Hospitals and healthcare providers are prohibited from denying treatment based on your ability to pay.\n\n* **Aftercare billing:** While you won't be asked to pay upfront, you may receive a bill for some services after your treatment. \n\n**What to do in an emergency:**\n\n* **Call 911:** If you or someone else is experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 immediately.\n* **Be upfront about your concerns:** If you're worried about costs, let the emergency medical personnel know. They are there to help and can guide you through the process.\n\n**If you have concerns about aftercare billing:**\n\n* **Contact the hospital:** Once you're feeling better, contact the hospital's billing department to discuss your financial situation.\n* **Explore payment options:** Many hospitals offer payment plans or assistance programs for those who are struggling financially.\n* **Seek legal advice:** If you're facing difficulties with billing, consider seeking legal advice from a consumer protection agency or lawyer.\n\n**Remember:** Your health is a priority. Don't hesitate to seek emergency medical care when needed.\n\n\nIf you have any further questions about healthcare in Canada, you can visit the website of your provincial or territorial health ministry.\n","transition_esl_to_native/esl/num_turns":3,"conversation_type":"transition_native_to_esl","conversation/fluency":"native","native/overall_refusal_rate":20,"conversation/income":0,"esl/all/refusal_rate":40,"conversation/education":"graduate","_step":242}
